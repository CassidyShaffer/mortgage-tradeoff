    ## Function definition from site:
# Definitions: 
#	  P = principal, the initial amount of the loan
#	  I = annual interest rate
#	  L = length of the loan in years, or at least the length over which the loan is amortized.
#	  J = monthly interest in decimal form = I / (12 x 100)
#	  M = monthly payment; formula: M = P * ( J / (1 - (1 + J) ^ -N))
#	  N = number of months over which loan is amortized = L x 12
